Well, welcome to the project of my application.

To keep this short, I work on this app in my free time and I wanted to make it an alternative to Duolingo and to
basically every single language learning app, since I find them lacking in some ways, especially regarding learning grammar.
Well, some day hopefully it will be.

So, few things before you test it out:
- Whole app is in polish and will remain such until I don't make language packs,
- You can make an acount, but DO NOT USE your actual e-mail, there's no verification for now so type anything with @gmail.com at the end,
eventually use admin/admin credentials,
- Translator doesn't work, do not try to use it, otherwise it will crash. It's not even mine, it's going to be replaced by some better tool anyway,
- Test mode works, however timer has not been implemented yet
- Exercise and lesson window are visually poorly implemented due to me still learning XAML and focusing on backend usability
- settings are still yet to be implemented, for now only background image can be changed

Current roadmap:
- built-in content editor
- security improvements
- advanced user functionality
- more learning modules: hearing and vocabulary/reading comprehension
- adding content
- built-in chat
- improved visuals
- an alternative for current azure cognitive services translator
- additional interactions between users
